## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- New `entire labs` command discovery for surfacing experimental commands ([#1130](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1130))
- `entire labs review` command — runs configured review skills inside an agent session, with single- and multi-agent picker flows, a Bubble Tea live dashboard, an optional cross-agent synthesis verdict, and `entire review attach` for post-hoc tagging. Reviews are recorded in checkpoint metadata so future commits know the code was reviewed ([#993](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/993), [#1105](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1105), [#1106](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1106), [#1107](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1107), [#1111](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1111), [#1112](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1112))

- kubectl-style external command resolution: `entire <name>` falls through to `entire-<name>` on PATH ([#1104](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1104))
- Managed plugin install directory and `ENTIRE_PLUGIN_DATA_DIR` for plugin discovery ([#1121](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1121))

### Changed

- Checkpoint commit signing now uses go-git's program signer for custom signing setups ([#1128](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1128))
- Checkpoints v2 (work in progress): dual-write to v1 and v2 during the transition; migration speedups via fast-path checks and rerun de-duplication; clearer completion message after the progress bar ([#1108](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1108), [#1109](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1109), [#1110](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1110), [#1114](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1114))

### Fixed

- `entire attach` now preserves `BaseCommit` and the active session phase ([#1102](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1102))
- Copilot CLI direct-prompt runs no longer fire session hooks unsafely ([#1100](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1100))
- `entire labs review` regressions: missing checkpoint context and review-flow correctness ([#1132](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1132))
- v2 transcripts are no longer sliced in final step ([#1120](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1120))

- Cursor-cli E2E stabilization ([#1101](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1101), [#1103](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1103))
- Dependency bumps: go-dependencies group (`mattn/go-isatty` 0.0.20 → 0.0.22, `go-git/x/plugin/objectsigner/auto` → 0.1.0), `go-git/go-git/v6` 6.0.0-alpha.2 → 6.0.0-alpha.3 ([#1122](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1122), [#1129](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1129), [#1131](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/1131))

### Thanks

- Removed deprecated `entireID` references ([#285](https://github.com/entireio/cli/pull/285))

### Docs
