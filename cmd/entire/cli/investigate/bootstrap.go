## TLDR

<!-- 2-4 sentences. The reader who only reads this section must understand:
the question, the answer (root cause / conclusion), and the single most
important piece of evidence. Updated every turn — until consensus, this
section reflects the current best hypothesis with confidence ("likely",
"confirmed"), not a final answer. -->

## Question

%s
%s
## Prior work

<!-- What was searched, what was found, what was ruled out. If nothing
relevant, say "no prior work found; searched for: <queries>". When a
finding cites a commit hash, also note the Entire-Checkpoint trailer
(if any) and what `+"`entire explain --checkpoint <id> --no-pager`"+`
revealed. -->

## System under investigation

<!-- A small diagram of the path under investigation. For
producer/consumer or queue-shaped systems, show: who writes the input,
who reads it, where retries happen, and the per-attempt cost. ASCII or
mermaid both fine. Two boxes and an arrow beats a paragraph. -->

## Approach

<!-- Each agent describes how they investigated. Append, don't overwrite. -->

## Findings

<!-- One numbered subsection per finding. Every claim needs concrete evidence:
file paths with line numbers (e.g. internal/cli/root.go:17), commands you ran,
test output, or direct quotes. -->

## Unknowns / Assumptions

<!-- Anything you could not confirm; assumptions that should be flagged. -->

## Conclusion

<!-- Filled in once consensus is reached. Stop here. Recommendations and
action items belong in a plan, not an investigation. -->
